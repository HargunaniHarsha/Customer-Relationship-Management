<h2 align=center> Control Access to Fields </h2>

<b> Create a profile and permission set to handle field access </b>
<p> Sales team members have most of the same object and field permissions as the Standard User profile. But your company wants to make sure that sales team members donâ€™t delete certain records, and that only senior sales members have access to certain fields.</p>
<p>For this challenge, use both profiles and permission sets to control object-level permissions. Make sure that all sales team members can create, edit, and view accounts and contacts, but NOT delete them. Then make sure that most sales members can't see or edit the Rating field on accounts, but some senior sales members can.</p>

<b> Challenge Requirements </b><br>
* Clone the Standard User profile:
  * Existing Profile: Standard User
  * Profile Name: Sales
* Control access for the Sales profile:
  * Standard Object Permissions:
    * Accounts: Read, Create, Edit
    * Contacts: Read, Create, Edit
  * Field Permissions:
    * Rating field on the Accounts object: no access
  * All other permissions from the Standard User profile remain as is
* Create a new permission set:
  * Label: Rating
  * API Name: Rating
  * User License: Salesforce
* Control access for the Rating permission set:
  * Field Permissions:
    * Rating field on the Accounts object: Read Access, Edit Access

<h2 align=center> Control Access to Records </h2>

<b> Configure organization-wide defaults </b>
<p> Your company needs a custom object for tracking projects. Project records should be visible only to the owner of the record and to users above the owner in the role hierarchy.

* Create a custom object:
  * Label: Project
  * Plural Label: Projects
  * Object Name: Project
  * Record Name: Project Name
  * Record Name Data Type: Text
* Configure organization-wide default sharing settings for the Project object so that Project records are visible only to the record owner.

<b> Solution: </b>
